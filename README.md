# Password Generator
A simple yet versatile password generator created with GameMaker.

Password Generator is capable of creating random strings suitable for secure password use from 4 to 1024 characters in length, and using a configurable combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.

### Features

- Preview the new password
- Generate a new password with a click or tap/hold of the space bar
- Copy the password to the clipboard
- Adjust the length using the +/- buttons, or by dragging left/right over the length count
- Toggle between "basic" special characters (the default), "full" special characters, or none (more information below)
- Visually adjust the percentage of letters, numbers, and special characters that the password string consists of

It also has the following options for ease of use:

- A toggle to hide the generated password from view
- A "big mode" button which makes the interface larger (good for high-dpi displays)
- Buttons to save and load the current configuration, or reset to the default options

Password Generator was created to generate passwords for you when you don't have access to a browser or other app that is capable of doing so.

### Special character options

You can toggled between three different settings for special characters. Password Generator was designed this way because sometimes, older websites don't allow certain characters to be used, so a more limited set is preferred. The special character options work as follows:

- Basic: Uses letters, numbers, and !@#$%^&\*()-+_=
- Full: Uses letters, numbers, and !@#$%^&\*()[]{}:;<>?,.~'+=-\_\"\\/|
- None: Only letters and numbers are used

### Use at your own risk

Bear in mind that, while passwords generated by this app are generally secure in their randomness, they can still follow certain patterns that may make them easier for an adversary to guess. Inspect/alter the code to suit your needs, and always follow best practices for creating passwords.
